==== PODS =====
- Always get an ip address assigned to a PODS
- Node IP is not the same as POD Ip address.

- When kubernetes is initally configured, an internal private network is configured
Example:

  Internal kubernetes address: 10.244.0.0.
  then: pods might have an internal IP address of 10.244.0.2
IP addresses are subject to change when pods are recreated

If two nodes are running kubernetes, with 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3 assigned
and each one has a pod inide with an internal address of 10.244.0.2. This only works
if they are individually deployed nodes.

This will not work if the pods are of the same cluster.


kubernetes does not automatically set up networking, it is expected we do it to meet
requirements.

* All containers/pods can communicate with each other without NAT
* All nodes can communicate with all containers and vice versa without communicate

FLannel/Weavenet is one of those solutions to help out with that.

To solve the issue with multiple pods in same cluster, the solutions
will assign internal address of 10.244.0.0 to first pod, then 10.244.1.0
to second pod.

Then internal addresses are assigned differently, first pod in 1st node assigned
10.244.0.2 and first pod in 2nd node is 10.244.1.2.

Every instance have a different ip address.
